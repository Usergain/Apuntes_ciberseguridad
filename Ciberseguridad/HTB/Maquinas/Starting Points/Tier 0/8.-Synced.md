**Rsync** efficiently transfers and synchronizes files or directories between a local machine, another host, a remote shell, or any combination. This uses an algorithm that minimizes the amount of data copied by moving only the portions of files that have changed.

Anyone working with Linux systems should use this powerful utility to improve productivity. For example, Rsync performs twice faster copying than SFTP.

Synchronizing folders or copying files manually can be time-consuming. The utility of Rsync can do most of the work by adding significant features to save time.

Even if you lose the connection during the transfer, this tool will start right where you left off as soon as the connection is established.

**Let’s power up this machine!**

**TASK 1 — What is the default port for rsync?**

The default port for running rsync is port _873_.

**TASK 2 — How many TCP ports are open on the remote host?**

The remote host has only _1_ port open, the rsync 873. Using Nmap with the switch -p-, it scans all the ports on the local host.

**TASK 3 — What is the protocol version used by rsync on the remote machine?**

The version of the protocol utilized was 31. By employing the switch -sV on Nmap, the service/version information is revealed.

**TASK 4 — What is the most common command name on Linux to interact with rsync?**

One of the most frequently used commands for interacting with rsync is “_rsync_.”

**TASK 5 — What credentials do you have to pass to rsync in order to use anonymous authentication? anonymous:anonymous, anonymous, None, rsync:rsync**

There is no need for authentication when using rsync anonymously, _none_.

**TASK 6 — What is the option to only list shares and files on rsync? (No need to include the leading — characters)**

To access all the “rsync” tool options, enter the command “rsync -h.” To narrow the search results, use the “grep” command and search for options containing the word “list.” This will display only the options that involve listing, and the appropriate answer for the task can be found there, _list-only_.

**SUBMIT FLAG**

All tasks must be completed to hack the target machine and obtain the flag successfully. Therefore, we can begin by exploring the target machine.

Firstly, we need to connect with rsync using the command “rsync rsync://ip address.”

We can then view the share information by entering the command “rsync rsync://ip address/public,” which will direct us to the public directory. Within this directory, we can find a list of files, including the all-important “flag.txt.”

To transfer this file to our local machine, we can use the command “rsync rsync://ip address/public/flag.txt . /”

Finally, we can view the file’s contents by listing the files and using a command to print the content.

This will reveal the flag, and we will have successfully hacked the last machine of Tier 0.
