> _Gobuster is a brute-force scanner tool to enumerate directories and files of websites. It will also assist in finding DNS subdomains and virtual host names. —_ Abricto Security website

It is essential because one of the primary actions made by an attacker is enumerating hidden directories and files. Although, in this challenge, it will only use some of the capacity that this has to offer us, in other machines of the _Starting Poing_ series, it will use this again. In addition to teaching how to install Gobuster, the [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gobuster-penetration-testing-tools-in-kali-tools/) shows some of the many uses of the tool.

**So let's pwed this machine and absorb more knowledge from the world of cybersecurity.**

**TASK 1 -Directory Brute-forcing is a technique used to check a lot of paths on a web server to find hidden pages. Which is another name for this? (i) Local File Inclusion, (ii) dir busting, (iii) hash cracking.**

_Dir busting_ is the name used for Directory Brute-forcing.

**TASK 2 — What switch do we use for Nmap's scan to specify that we want to perform version detection?**

The switch used in Nmap to determine the version of the service running on a port is _-sV_.

**TASK 3 — What does Nmap report is the service identified as running on port 80/tcp?**

By default, the service running on port 80 is _HTTP_. However, using Nmap, it was possible to check its information.

**TASK 4 — What server name and version of service is running on port 80/tcp?**

After using a Nmap scan, it shows _nginx 1.14.2_. NGINX is software for reverse proxying, load balancing, web serving, and media streaming, among other uses.

**TASK 5 — What switch do we use to specify to Gobuster we want to perform dir busting specifically?**

_Dir_ is used to find content in a specific target domain or subdomain.

- Before using Gobuster, it is necessary to check if the machine already has it installed. Unfortunately, this tool doesn't come preinstalled on Linux. The command "_gobuster status_" shows that it wasn't found and asks if I want to install it. So typing Y for yes automatically run the command to install. After that, it's really to use!

- Using the command "gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u 10.129.45.56," it was possible to run the gobuster to perform the Directory Brute-forcing.

> dir : specify we are using the directory busting mode of the tool
> 
> -w : specify a wordlist, a collection of common directory names that are typically used for sites
> 
> -u : specify the target’s IP address

**TASK 6 — When using gobuster to dir bust, what switch do we add to make sure it finds PHP pages?**

It is possible to enumerate hidden files for that specific type using the switch "-x" followed by the file extension on Gobuster. In this case, _-x php_ will do.

**TASK 7 — What page is found during our dir busting activities?**

It was found on the _admin.php_ page.

**TASK 8 — What is the HTTP status code reported by Gobuster for the discovered page?**

Status _200_ was found, which means everything is connected and authenticated.

**SUBMIT FLAG**

- In the web browser, type the IP address for the tag machine, and it will open the Welcome Page in case everything is correct.

- Now to open the webpage found in the dir busting activities, the admin.php need to be added after the IP address. An authentication page will require a username and password, so let's use "admin" for both.

- **Ta-daa!** Finally, it shows the flag that completes the lab.
