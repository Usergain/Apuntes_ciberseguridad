> Remote Desktop Protocol or RDP software **provides access to a desktop or application hosted on a remote host**. It allows you to connect, access, and control data and resources on a remote host as if you were doing it locally. -Parallels

The tools can be used for positive practices, such as accessing a customer’s computer to diagnose the problem on their machines or even a worker who needs to access the company machine while traveling or working from home. And bad things as well, being vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as computer worms and hash attacks.

So, let’s solve the tasks suggested by the lab to learn more about the tool.

**TASK 1 — What does the 3-letter acronym RDP stand for?**

**TASK 2 — What is a 3-letter acronym that refers to interaction with the host through a command line interface?**

The command-line interface is a text-based environment that runs programs, interacts with the computer, and manages computer files. The acronym for this tool is _CLI._

**TASK 3 — What about graphical user interface interactions?**

_GUI,_ Graphical User Interface, permits users to interact with the system using graphical features like icons, windows, and menus.

**TASK 4 — What is the name of an old remote access tool that came without encryption by default and listens on TCP port 23?**

Telnet is the remote access listed by default on TCP by 23_._

**TASK 5 — What is the name of the service running on port 3389 TCP?**

It uses the NMAP command to scan the networking and list the open ports. And it was possible to find the service on port 3389 _ms-web-server, which stand for_ Microsoft Remote Display Protocol (Terminal Server).
